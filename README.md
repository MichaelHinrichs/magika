Magika is a novel AI powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized Keras model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU.

> [! IMPORTANT]
> We have just released new things! Read more [here](./NEWS.md).

In an evaluation on over 200 content types (covering both binary and textual file formats), Magika achieves close to 99% precision and recall. Magika is used at scale to help improve Google usersâ€™ safety by routing Gmail, Drive, and Safe Browsing files to the proper security and content policy scanners, and it is integrated with VirusTotal.

You can quickly try Magika by using our [web demo](https://google.github.io/magika/), which runs locally in your browser!

## Highlights

- Available as a command line (written in Rust), a Python API, a Rust API, and an experimental TFJS version (which powers our [web demo](https://google.github.io/magika/)).
- Trained on a dataset of almost 100M files across more than 200 content types.
- On our evaluation, Magika achieves close to 99% average precision and recall, outperforming existing approaches.
- More than 200 content types (see [supported content types by our latest model](https://github.com/google/magika/assets/models/standard_v2_1/README.md)).
- After the model is loaded (this is a one-off overhead), the inference time is about 5ms/10ms per file, depending on your environment.
- You can invoke Magika with even thousands of files at the same time. You can also use `-r` for recursively scanning a directory.
- Near-constant inference time independently from the file size; Magika only uses a limited subset of the file's bytes.
- Magika uses a per-content-type threshold system that determines whether to "trust" the prediction for the model, or whether to return a generic label, such as "Generic text document" or "Unknown binary data". No additional tuning is required.
- Support three different prediction modes, which tweak the tolerance to errors: `high-confidence`, `medium-confidence`, and `best-guess`.
- The client and bindings are already open source! (And we are working on open sourcing the rest of the code base.)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Magika is available as `magika` on PyPI:

```shell
$ pip install magika  # or pipx install magika
```

This will install the `magika` python package, which ships the new CLI (written in Rust), and the `Magika` python module.

TODO: add how to install from rust.

### Running in Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/google/magika
cd magika/
docker build -t magika .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/magika magika -r /magika/tests_data/basic
```

### Quick Examples

Usage: magika [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

  Magika - Determine type of FILEs with deep-learning.

Options:
  -r, --recursive                 When passing this option, magika scans every
                                  file within directories, instead of
                                  outputting "directory"
  --json                          Output in JSON format.
  --jsonl                         Output in JSONL format.
  -i, --mime-type                 Output the MIME type instead of a verbose
                                  content type description.
  -l, --label                     Output a simple label instead of a verbose
                                  content type description. Use --list-output-
                                  content-types for the list of supported
                                  output.
  -c, --compatibility-mode        Compatibility mode: output is as close as
                                  possible to `file` and colors are disabled.
  -s, --output-score              Output the prediction score in addition to
                                  the content type.
  -m, --prediction-mode [best-guess|medium-confidence|high-confidence]
  --batch-size INTEGER            How many files to process in one batch.
  --no-dereference                This option causes symlinks not to be
                                  followed. By default, symlinks are
                                  dereferenced.
  --colors / --no-colors          Enable/disable use of colors.
  -v, --verbose                   Enable more verbose output.
  -vv, --debug                    Enable debug logging.
  --generate-report               Generate report useful when reporting
                                  feedback.
  --version                       Print the version and exit.
  --list-output-content-types     Show a list of supported content types.
  --model-dir DIRECTORY           Use a custom model.

#### Python API

TODO: update

Examples:

```python
>>> from magika import Magika
>>> m = Magika()
>>> res = m.identify_bytes(b"# Example\nThis is an example of markdown!")
>>> print(res.output.ct_label)
markdown
```


See [python documentation](./docs/python.md) for detailed documentation.


#### Rust bindings


#### Experimental TFJS model & npm package

We also provide Magika as an experimental package for people interested in using in a web app.
Note that Magika JS implementation performance is significantly slower and you should expect to spend 100ms+ per file.

See [js documentation](./docs/js.md) for the details.


## Development Setup

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for development and packaging:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/google/magika
$ cd magika/python
$ uv sync  # install dependencies
$ uv run magika -r ../tests_data/basic  # run some tests
```


## Important Documentation

- [List of supported content types by our latest model.](./assets/models/standard_v2_1/README.md)

## Known Limitations & Contributing

Magika significantly improves over the state of the art, but there's always room for improvement! More work can be done to increase detection accuracy, support for additional content types, bindings for more languages, etc.

This initial release is not targeting polyglot detection, and we're looking forward to seeing adversarial examples from the community.
We would also love to hear from the community about encountered problems, misdetections, features requests, need for support for additional content types, etc.

Check our open GitHub issues to see what is on our roadmap and please report misdetections or feature requests by either opening GitHub issues (preferred) or by emailing us at magika-dev@google.com.
